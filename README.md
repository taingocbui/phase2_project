Author: Tai Ngoc Bui <br>
Date Completion: March 24th, 2024

## 1.Business Understanding
This data exploratory project focuses on analyzing characteristics of successful movies at the box office to support the company's strategic investment in the movie industry. The goal is to gain valuable insights contributing to movie production success and provide meaningful recommendations to major stakeholders of the investments.

## 2.Data Understanding
The dataset used in this analysis extracted from various different movie sources including:

* [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)
* [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) <br>

As these datasets were collected from different sources, they have different formats. While The Movie DB and the Numbers datasets are compressed as CVS files, the IMDb, the largest dataset among the three, is stored within a SQLite database.<br>

These datasets not only contain movies' information on their cast, production crew, budget, and revenues, etc. but also the public opinions regarding the movies' success such as ratings and votes.


## 3. Objectives
* Explore and analyze three different datasets to identify general trends in the movie industry, and the major factors that contribute to the sucess of a movie.
* Provide data-driven evidence to support confidence in the strategic investment and the best strategies to minimize the overall investment risks.
* Identify a list of potential directors and producers based on their track records to ensure the success of stakeholders' investment in the movie industry.

## 4. Key Questions
With this project, I will address specific questions such as:
* What specific measure should be used to compare the sucess of movies and their production team?
* Would it be possible to reduce investment risk if we prioritizing certain movies' genres or release month?
* Who should be prioritized to be our studios' lead directors and producers?
* What should we learn from the success of past blockbusters?

## 5. Exploratory Data Analysis
For this project, I decided to use Return on Investment (ROI) as the main measure to compare the sucess of various movies, directors, and producers.
