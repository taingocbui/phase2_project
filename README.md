## Business Understanding
This data exploratory project focuses on analyzing characteristics of successful movies at the box office to support the company's strategic investment in the movie industry. The goal is to gain valuable insights contributing to movie production success and provide meaningful recommendations to major stakeholders of the investments.

## Data Understanding
The dataset used in this analysis extracted from various different movie sources including:
* [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)
* [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
As these datasets were collected from different sources, they have different formats. While TMDB and the Numbers datasets are compressed as CVS files, the IMDb, the largest dataset among the three, is stored within a SQLite database.<br>
These datasets not only contain movies' information on their cast, production crew, budget, and revenues, etc. but also the public opinions regarding the movies' success such as ratings and votes.
